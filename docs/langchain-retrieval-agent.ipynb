            "['Snippet 1:\\nstry today. For example, mobile health\\r\\napplications have become quite popular. Smartwatches can collect health-related data using various\\r\\nsensors and mobile health applications can leverage that data to provide useful reports to users as they\\r\\nexercise. Using a native application framework provides quicker load times, smooth animations and\\r\\ntransitions, optimal security, and a seamless user experience, to make it easier to immediately track and\\r\\naccess health-care data.\\r\\nDrawbacks to using native application framework include a longer development process, increased cost,\\r\\ncomplex maintenance and updates, platform dependency, regulatory and compliance issues, and end-user\\r\\nbarriers.\\r\\nThe Benefits and Drawbacks Between Native, Web, and Hybrid Mobile Application\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nNative applications have the benefits of accessing device-specific hardware and sensors (e.g., camera,\\r\\naccelerometer), data (e.g., location, contacts), and are optimized for performance.\\r\\nHowever, they have the drawbacks of being device-dependent and available primarily through proprietary app\\r\\nstores (Google Play for Android and Apple’s App Store for iOS). Developers need to learn different languages\\r\\nand libraries for the devices. However, cross-platform development is possible with frameworks (e.g., Flutter,\\r\\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile), allowing developers to code in a single language and run solutions on both\\r\\nplatforms.\\r\\nWeb apps can also run in a browser on mobile devices. They have the distinct advantage of responsiveness\\r\\nand can run on various screen sizes—thus allowing for a single codebase that can increase productivity and\\r\\nreduce cost. Disadvantages to web apps on mobile devices are limited access to hardware and software\\r\\nfeatures, lower performance than native apps, and web apps may perform differently depending on the\\r\\nmobile browser. Traditionally, web apps didn’t look like native apps. In 2017, Google introduced Progressive\\r\\nWeb Apps for Android, allowing web apps to look and feel similar to native apps.\\r\\nFinally, hybrid apps are web apps wrapped inside a native device framework (e.g., Apache Cordova). These\\r\\napps have the advantages of using traditional web application development while accessing and utilizing\\r\\ndevice functions and running on multiple mobile platforms. The drawbacks are reduced speed and potential\\r\\nsecurity vulnerabilities found in the framework.\\r\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 575CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\r\\nSoftware Patterns and Frameworks\\r\\nAs discussed in Chapter 9 Software Engineering and Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures\\r\\nManagement, architectural styles, architectural patterns, and design patterns are typically used to enforce\\r\\nthe quality attributes of software solutions. To facilitate the creation and maintenance of web applications\\r\\nand scalable transactional websites, web application frameworks and native application frameworks that\\r\\nleverage applicable patterns, such as MVC, were created and improved over the past couple of decades.\\r\\nWeb frameworks are used within web application frameworks to facilitate the use of HTML5, CSS3, and\\r\\nJavaScript and to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern\\r\\ntarget devices. Web application frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or\\r\\nupdating web pages. Native application frameworks take advantage of capabilities available on specific\\r\\ntarget devices such as iPhones and Android phones. Organizations in many industries rely on web\\r\\napplications and related frameworks to conduct business daily.\\r\\nWeb 3.0 Applications\\r\\nWeb 3.0 is the next phase of the Web. It is still being realized, and similar to Web 1.0 and 2.0, it can only be\\r\\nfully understood in hindsight. The technology and uses of the Web overlap between the phases, with newer\\r\\nphases becoming preferred over their predecessor phases. If Web 1.0 was the read-only web, and Web 2.0 was\\r\\nthe participation (write) web, then Web 3.0 may be the read, write, and execute web.\\r\\nTim Berners-Lee had referred to Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web, a system of autonomous agents, which are\\r\\nsoftware programs that respond to events.

It directly\\naccesses the hardware of the device, such as the GPS, camera, and microphone, which allows for features\\nlike real-time location sharing, voice and video calls, and media sharing.\\n• Instagram: Instagram is a photo- and video-sharing app. Native development helps Instagram manage\\nhigh-quality media content efficiently, apply real-time filters, and smoothly handle in-app animations.\\n• Uber Eats: Uber Eats is a food-delivery service that operates as a native app on mobile devices. Being\\nnative allows the app to use device-specific features, such as GPS for tracking the delivery person’s\\nlocation in real time.\\n• Spotify: Spotify uses its native app to deliver personalized music and podcast streaming services.

Resiliency is provided at the core of the\\narchitecture. As with any software system, failure can also occur in distributed systems and hardware.\\nTransient failures can also occur in networks. The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue\\nto function is called resiliency. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state\\nfollowing a failure minimizing downtime and data loss. An application is resilient if it (1) has high\\navailability, which is the ability for an application to continue running in a healthy state without\\nsignificant downtime; and (2) supports disaster recovery, which is the ability of the application to recover\\nfrom rare but major incidents: nontransient, wide-scale failures, such as service disruption that affects an\\nentire region. Applications can be made resilient by increasing redundancy with multinode clusters,\\nmultiregion deployments, and data replication. Other strategies for implementing resiliency include\\nretries to handle transient network failures, adding more nodes to a cluster and load balance across them,\\nthrottling high-volume users, and applying circuit breakers to prevent an application from repeatedly\\ntrying an operation that is likely to fail.\\nTesting for resiliency requires testing how the end-to-end workload performs under failure conditions that\\nonly occur intermittently—for e xample, injecting failures by crashing processes, including expired\\ncertificates, making dependent services unavailable, and so on.

The\\nmemoryis a means of addressing information in a computer by storing it in consistent locations, while the\\nnetworkrefers to the various technological devices that are connected and share information. The hardware\\nand physical components of a computer that permanently house a computer’s data are called storage.\\nOne way to understand computers is from a hardware perspective: computers leverage digital electronics and\\nthe physics of materials used to develop transistors. For example, many of today’s computers rely on the\\nphysical properties of a brittle, crystalline metalloid called silicon, which makes it suitable for representing\\ninformation. The batteries that power many of today’s smartphones and mobile devices rely on lithium, a soft,\\nsilvery metal mostly harvested from minerals in Australia, Zimbabwe, and Brazil, as well as from continental\\nbrine deposits in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Computer engineers combine these substances to build\\ncircuitry and information pathways at the microscopic scale to form the physical basis for modern computers.\\nHowever, the physical basis of computers was not always silicon. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and\\nComputer (ENIAC) was completed in 1945, making it one of the earliest digital computers. The ENIAC operated\\non different physical principles. Instead of silicon, the ENIAC used the technology of a vacuum tube, a physical\\ndevice like a light bulb that was used as memory in early digital computers. When the “light” in the vacuum\\ntube is off, the vacuum tube represents the number 0. When the “light” is on, the vacuum tube represents the\\nnumber 1. When thousands of vacuum tubes are combined in a logical way, we suddenly have memory. The\\nENIAC is notable in computer history because it was the first general-purpose computer, meaning that it could\\nrun not just a single program but rather any program specified by a programmer. The ENIAC was often run\\nand programmed by women programmers (Figure 1.4). Despite its age and differences in hardware properties,\\nit shares a fundamental and surprising similarity with modern computers. Anything that can be computed on\\n1.1 • Computer Science 13today’s computers can also be computed by the ENIAC given the right circumstances—just trillions of times\\nmore slowly.\\nFigure1.4 This image depicts women programmers holding boards used in computers such as the ENIAC, many of which were\\ndesigned expressly for ballistics and ordinance guidance research. Today, these room-size computers can be reproduced at a literally\\nmicroscopic scale—basically invisible to the human e ye. (credit: modification of \"Women holding parts of the first four Army\\ncomputers\" by U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\\nHow is this possible? The algorithmic principles that determine how results are computed makes up software.\\nAlmost all computers, from the ENIAC to today’s computers, are considered Turing-complete(or\\nComputationally Universal, as opposed to specialized computing devices such as scientific calculators) because\\nthey share the same fundamental model for computing results and every computer has the ability to run any\\nalgorithm. Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician who was highly influential in the development\\nof theoretical computer science, which focuses on the mathematical processes behind software, and provided\\na formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine. A Turing-complete\\ncomputer stores data in memory (either using vacuum tubes or silicon) and manipulates that data according\\nto a computer program, which is an algorithm that can be run on a computer. These programs are\\nrepresented using symbols and instructions written in a programming languageconsisting of symbols and\\ninstructions that can be interpreted by the computer. Programs are also stored in memory, which allows\\nprogrammers to modify and improve programs by changing the instructions.\\nWhile both hardware and software are important to the practical operation of computers, computer science’s\\nhistorical roots in mathematics also emphasize a third perspective. Whereas software focuses on the program\\ndetails for solving problems with computers, theoretical computer science focuses on the mathematical\\nprocesses behind software. The idea of Turing-completeness is a foundational concept in theoretical computer\\nscience, which considers how computers in general—not just the ENIAC or today’s computers, but even\\ntomorrow’s computers that we haven’t yet invented—can solve pr oblems. This theoretical perspective expands\\ncomputer science knowledge by contributing ideas about (1) whether a problem can be computed by a Turing-\\ncomplete computer at all, (2) how that problem might be computed using an algorithm, and (3) how quickly or\\nefficiently a computer can run such an algorithm. The answers to these questions suggest the limits of what\\nwe can achieve with computers from a technical perspective: Using mathematical ideas, is it possible to use a\\ncomputer to compute all problems? If the answer to a problem is yes, how much of a computing resource is\\nneeded to get the answer?\\nClearly both humans and computers have their strengths and limitations. An example of a problem that\\nhumans can solve but computers struggle with is interpreting subtle emotions or making moral judgments in\\ncomplex social situations. While computers can process data and recognize patterns, they cannot fully\\nunderstand the nuances of human emotions or ethics, which often involve context, empathy, and experience.\\n14 1 • Introduction to Computer Science\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgOn the flip side, there are tasks that neither computers nor humans can perform, such as accurately predicting\\nchaotic systems like long-term weather patterns. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),\\ncomputer functions that perform tasks, such as visual perception and decision-making processes that usually\\nare performed by human intelligence, these problems remain beyond our collective reach due to the inherent\\nunpredictability and complexity of certain natural systems.\\nTheoretical computer science is often emphasized in undergraduate computer science programs because\\nacademic computer science emerged from mathematics, often to the detriment of perspectives that center on\\nthe social and technical values embodied by applications of computer technology.

This can then inform\\r\\nthe distribution of vaccines to assist the most impacted groups first.\\r\\n3.1 • Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms 99Complex Data\\r\\nNow that we have seen several data structure implementations for abstract data, let us consider how these\\r\\ndata structures are used in practice. Recall that we compared calculators whose algorithms operated on\\r\\nnumbers with the idea of a computer whose algorithms operated on complex data. Data structures can be\\r\\nused to represent complex data by modeling hierarchy and relationships.\\r\\nWe might represent an online retail store as a map associating each item with details such as an image, a brief\\r\\ndescription, price, and the number of items in stock. This map makes some online storefront features easier to\\r\\nimplement than others. Given an item, this map makes it easy to retrieve the details associated with that item.\\r\\nOn the other hand, it is not so easy to sort items by price, sort items by popularity, or search for an item by\\r\\nkeywords in its description. All these features could be implemented with additional data structures. We can\\r\\ncombine multiple data structures together to implement these features. In computer science, we use database\\r\\nsystems (see Chapter 8 Data Management) that work behind the scenes in many applications to manage these\\r\\ndata structures and facilitate long-term storage and access to large amounts of data.\\r\\nJust as calculators have algorithms for calculating numbers, computers have algorithms for computing\\r\\ncomplex data. Data structures represent these complex data, and algorithms act on these data structures.\\r\\n3.2 Algorithm Design and Discovery\\r\\nLearning Objectives\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n• Understand the approach to solving algorithmic problems\\r\\n• Explain how algorithm design patterns are used to solve new problems\\r\\n• Describe how algorithms are analyzed\\r\\nOur introduction to data structures focused primarily on representing complex data. But computer scientists\\r\\nare also interested in designing algorithms for solving a wider variety of problems beyond storing and\\r\\nretrieving data. For example, they may want to plan a route between a start location and an end location on a\\r\\nmap. Although every real-world problem is unique, computer scientists can use a general set of principles to\\r\\ndesign solutions without needing to develop new algorithms from scratch. Just like how many data structures\\r\\ncan represent the same abstract data type, many different solutions exist to solve the same problem.\\r\\nAlgorithmic Problem Solving\\r\\nAn algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that takes any input and computes the corresponding\\r\\noutput, while algorithmic problem-solving refers to a particular set of approaches and methods for\\r\\ndesigning algorithms that draws on computing’s historical connections to the study of mathematical problem\\r\\nsolving. Early computer scientists were influenced by mathematical formalism and mathematical problem\\r\\nsolving. George Pólya’s 1945 book, How to Solve It, outlines a process for solving problems that begins with a\\r\\nformal understanding of the problem and ends with a solution to the problem. As an algorithm\\'s input size is\\r\\nalways finite, finding a solution to an algorithmic problem can always be accomplished by exhaustive search.\\r\\nTherefore, the goal of algorithmic problem-solving, as opposed to mathematical problem solving, is to find an\\r\\n“efficient” solution, either in terms of execution time (e.g., number of computer instructions) or space used\\r\\n(e.g., computer memory size). Consequently, the study of algorithmic problem-solving emphasizes the formal\\r\\nproblem or task, with specific input data and output data corresponding to each input. There are many other\\r\\nways to solve problems with computers, but this mathematical approach remains the dominant approach in\\r\\nthe field. Here are a few well-known problems in computer science that we will explore later in this chapter.\\r\\nA data structure problem is a computational problem involving the storage and retrieval of elements for\\r\\nimplementing abstract data types such as lists, sets, maps, and priority queues. These include:\\r\\n• searching, or the problem of retrieving a target element from a collection of elements\\r\\n100 3 • Data Structures and Algorithms\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org• sorting, or the problem of rearranging elements into a logical order\\r\\n• hashing, or the problem of assigning a meaningful integer index for each object\\r\\nA graph problem is a computational problem involving graphs that represent relationships between data.\\r\\nThese include:\\r\\n• traversal, or the problem of exploring all the vertices in a graph\\r\\n• minimum spanning tree is the problem of finding a lowest-cost way to connect all the vertices to each\\r\\nother\\r\\n• shortest path is the problem of finding the lowest-cost way to get from one vertex to another\\r\\nA string problem is a computational problem involving text or information represented as a sequence of\\r\\ncharacters. Examples include:\\r\\n• matching, or the problem of searching for a text pattern within a document\\r\\n• compression, or the problem of representing information using less data storage\\r\\n• cryptography, or the problem of masking or obfuscating text to make it unintelligible\\r\\nModeling\\r\\nComputer scientists focus on defining a problem model, often simply called a model, which is a simplified,\\r\\nabstract representation of more complex real-world problems. They apply the algorithmic problem-solving\\r\\nprocess mentioned previously to design algorithms when defining models. Algorithms model phenom\\nCited Pages: 109, 110, 111']\n",

It draws from at least five distinct sections of the book: pages 23-25 (how computers work, including hardware, software, and computation principles), 85-87 (web and native app development frameworks and architectures), 585-587 (modern web application architectures, Web 2.0/3.0, and frameworks), 668-670 (practical web app development with frameworks and tools), and 109-111 (algorithms, data structures, and complexity). Each concept in the guide is directly supported by the cited textbook content, and the guide does not introduce any information not found in the book. The roadmap is clear, with each major topic (computers, web app development, algorithms) covered by multiple relevant sections, ensuring a comprehensive learning path.
